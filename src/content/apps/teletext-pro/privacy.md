This privacy policy explains how the App handles your information.

## What the App Does

Teletext Pro is a native iOS app that provides a web view for browsing publicly available teletext content from ARD's web-based teletext service at [ard-text.de](https://www.ard-text.de). All content displayed in the App is owned by and originates directly from ARD. The App does not host, modify, or redistribute any of this content - it simply provides a convenient mobile interface for accessing it.

## Data Collection

Teletext Pro does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal data. The App:

- Does not require an account or login
- Does not collect analytics or usage data
- Does not use tracking technologies or advertising identifiers
- Does not use cookies
- Does not access your contacts, photos, location, or any other device data

## Network Requests

The App makes network requests solely to fetch publicly available teletext pages from ARD (`ard-text.de`). These requests are made directly from your device to ARD's servers. Teletext Pro does not route these requests through any intermediary server and does not log or monitor them.

## Third-Party Services

The App does not integrate any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs. No data is shared with third parties.

## Data Storage

The App does not store any data on your device beyond what is required by the operating system to run the application.

## Children's Privacy

The App does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13.

## Changes to This Policy

If this privacy policy is updated, the revised version will be posted on this page with an updated date.
