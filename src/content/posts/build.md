# Build Berlin

Build Berlin is a community of builders who meet once every six weeks to present apps that they've built. While we welcome any tech stack, we're particularly focused on react native (with expo) as we believe that it's the best way to build quality apps quickly. Build Berlin is not like your average hackathon event. Instead of just presenting some slides on stage, we go deep into each app to try to understand what can be improved. This can be UI/UX feedback or technical feedback to improve performance of the app.

Aside from the technical deep dives, we also want apps to succeed in the market. We've all heard the YC slogan "make something people want". We want to help each other make something people want. Every now and then we'll invite a select group of investors into the audience who can help teams raise a small amount of money to accelerate the growh of individuals/teams who have built an app with potential to succeed.

We are strictly looking for technical founders who are able to build apps.

Do not apply if you're looking to be entertained in a fancy office with Pizza and drinks. The value you get is a community of strong builders. We're scrappy when it comes to the events itself. It's about what we build and how we build it. Not about the event itself.

If you're interested in joining the community, please reach out to us at [buildberlin@gmail.com](mailto:buildberlin@gmail.com).

Your skillset:

- You know how to code in TypeScript
- You know how to build apps with React Native and Expo
- You have an eye for UI/UX design
- You are a confident presenter, i.e. you can sell
- Ideally you have some experience with building apps in crypto and/or AI

Why just developers?

With the current state of AI, we are in a unique point in time where developers' productivity is at an all time high thanks to LLMs. We need to seize this moment to build products of lasting value that yield us life-long returns before the wave of AGI is crashing down on us.
